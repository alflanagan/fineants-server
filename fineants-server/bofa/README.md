# BofA module

I've introduced some confusion here, as the easiest way to get import of Bank of America
statements set up is with a dedicated app. Presumably at some point the transactions
will be consolidated into `accounts.models.Transactions`. Not sure if we'll be able to generalize `bofa` away
entirely or if there will always be some BofA functionality that's unique.
